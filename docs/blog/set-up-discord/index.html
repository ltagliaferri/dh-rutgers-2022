      <h1>Set up Discord</h1>
      <article class="paragraph text-lg"><h1>Discord</h1>
<p>We will be using a Discord server called <strong>DH Rutgers Spring 2022</strong> which is accessible to you if you are signed up or logged in via <a href="https://discord.com/channels/933153131271962634/933153131271962637">this link</a>.</p>
<p>The invite links will be distributed in our class sessions.</p>
<h2>What is Discord</h2>
<p>Similar to Slack, Discord is a chat platform that can bring communities together. It can be used to communicate through text or voice, providing both asynchronous and realtime options. Discord is a tool we can leverage to be in communication, share resources, or have off-topic discussions.</p>
<p>Discord is considered freemium software, offering both free and paid (subscription) plans. For our use case, we will be using the free version. Discord is not open source and is a for-profit company. You can read more about Discord's history and monetization on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discord_(software)">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>Discord's official documentation provides a helpful <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033931551-Getting-Started">Getting Started guide</a>.</p>
<p>You can choose to download <a href="https://discord.com/download">Desktop Discord</a> for your relevant computer operating system, or the app for Android devices from the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.discord">Google Play store</a>, or the app for Apple devices from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/discord/id985746746">Apple App Store</a>.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for you to download the Discord app as you can access Discord directly in your browser through the Discord <a href="https://discord.com/login">web client</a>.</p>
<p>To create an account, you can navigate to <a href="https://discord.com/register">https://discord.com/register</a> in order to register. You will be asked for a valid email address, username, and password. Note that you will want to use an email address you actually have access to so that you can confirm your account.</p>
<p>After creating your account, you should confirm it by checking your email and clicking on the relevant link.</p>
<p>From here, you can join our DH Rutgers Spring 2022 server and any other servers you may be interested in. For example, you may want to join <a href="https://discord.com/invite/QG2XwsrsN4">The Digital Humanities</a> Discord or the <a href="https://discord.gg/fTaQ8xwG">humanities in tech</a> Discord.</p>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>Our Discord server will be what we make of it, and we will continue to discuss is efficacy throughout the course.</p>
