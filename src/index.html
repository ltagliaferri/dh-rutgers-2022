  <h1>Digital Humanities Theories and Practice</h1>
  <h2>Course Description</h2>
  <p class="text-lg paragraph">
    This course will provide a practical and theoretical approach to the Digital Humanities, the computational humanities, and their intersections with the Public Humanities. Balancing practical guidance on tools and methodologies with modes for entering into the research of participants, the course will foster experimentation with and critical exploration of digital scholarship coupled with humanistic inquiry. We will have labs on Linux, multilingual humanities data, static websites, Python, and data visualization. With an emphasis on the historical literary humanities, weâ€™ll broaden our discussion to include current scholarship in the digital archives and digital pedagogy (especially within language and literature) to provide us with breadth for understanding the diversity of the field.
